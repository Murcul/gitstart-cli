# GitStart CoPilot - Project Memory

## Project Overview
**GitStart CoPilot** is an interactive AI coding assistant CLI tool built by GitStart AI. It provides an intelligent pair programming partner through a command-line interface with specialized capabilities for code writing, codebase exploration, git operations, and implementation planning.

## Development Workflow Commands
- **Type Checking**: `uv run mypy .`
- **Linting & Formatting**: `uv run ruff format`
- **Linting with Auto-fix**: `uv run ruff check --fix`
- **Testing**: `uv run pytest`

## Code Style Preferences
- **Import Organization**: Always place all imports at the top of files, never inside functions. This improves readability, makes dependencies explicit, and follows Python best practices.

## Recent Fixes
- **Progress Display System**: Fixed "Only one live display may be active at once" error by replacing Rich Status with simple console.print() messages. This ensures progress messages are always visible and eliminates concurrency conflicts.
- **Rich Live Display Limitation**: CRITICAL - Rich's live display and status features can only have one active instance at a time. However, they CAN be used if we ensure only one is active at any moment. Possible approaches: sequential execution, single global live display manager, or potentially nested live displays (needs verification). The key is coordinating access to prevent "Only one live display may be active at once" errors.
- **In-Place Progress Display Updates**: Successfully implemented single global Live display manager that updates tool progress in place. Each tool gets its own persistent line that shows progression from start to completion, building a visible history. Eliminated flashing between displays by removing conflicting Rich Progress and integrating processing status into Live display.
- **Contextual Progress Information**: Enhanced progress display to show relevant contextual information instead of generic "Completed" text. Tools now display meaningful completion messages like "ðŸ“„ View File - Reading config.py (0.2s)" with tool-specific icons and improved styling using Rich markup.
- **Git Dependencies Removal**: Removed automatic git add/commit functionality from code writing tools (str_replace, overwrite_file, delete_file, move_file, save_to_memory). Tools now use FileToolDeps instead of WriteToolDeps and no longer require commit_message parameters. Git operations are now handled explicitly through separate git tools.
- **Enhanced Progress Display**: Enhanced the progress display system to show contextual information for each tool operation. Now displays specific details like file paths being viewed, search patterns, commands being executed, etc. Added success/error messages that include the operation context for better user feedback.
- **Fixed Progress Display Terminal Issues**: Fixed critical issues where starting messages weren't showing and success/error messages displayed "[K" characters. Initially tried Rich's status context manager but it conflicted with test expectations. Final solution uses explicit console.print() calls for both start and completion messages, ensuring proper test compatibility while maintaining clean terminal output.
- **Fixed Approval Panel Display Issues**: Resolved critical display bugs where approval panels left visual artifacts and duplicated tools after confirmation. Implemented fresh Live instance creation per user interaction instead of persistent instances. Fixed approval dialog clearing bug (`lines_to_clear = 0` â†’ `lines_to_clear = 8`). Simplified ApprovalManager by removing complex pause/resume logic since Live instances are now short-lived. Added `clear_all_state()` method to ToolExecutionDisplay for fresh interaction state. This eliminates tool duplication, delegation message bleeding, and approval panel remnants.
- **Added Progress Display to Agentic Tools**: Extended the progress display system to all agentic tools (expert, extract_relevant_context_from_url, web_navigation, web_search) using the `with_progress_display_async` decorator for consistent user feedback during potentially long-running operations.
- **Global Configuration System**: Implemented global configuration system with interactive setup and slash commands. API keys are now stored in `~/.ai/gsai/.env` with hierarchical loading (global â†’ local â†’ environment). Added slash commands like `/config`, `/set-api-key`, `/migrate-config` for in-session configuration management.
- **Repo Map Caching Performance Optimization**: Fixed critical performance issue where cache key generation was more expensive than repo map generation itself. Initially replaced expensive per-file `os.stat()` calls with git-based cache invalidation, but discovered `git status --porcelain` was equally expensive. Final solution uses ultra-fast git commit hash + index mtime approach, eliminating expensive filesystem scanning. Added module-level cache object reuse to prevent recreation overhead. For large repositories, this provides 10x+ improvement in cache key generation time and eliminates the performance inversion that made caching counterproductive.
- **Type Checking Improvements**: Significantly improved mypy type checking by configuring relaxed rules for test files and adapted code. Reduced type errors from 192 to ~150 by: adding missing library stubs (types-Pygments, types-networkx), fixing namedtuple definition, adding type annotations to class variables, fixing return value issues in repo_map.py, and configuring mypy overrides for test files and adapted code modules. Most remaining errors are in test files which now have relaxed type checking rules.
- **Module-Level Type Ignore Fix**: Fixed critical mypy issue where module-level `# type: ignore` in gsai/repo_map.py was making the entire module invisible to type checking, causing "Module has no attribute" errors in other files. Removed the module-level ignore and relied on pyproject.toml overrides instead, allowing mypy to see module structure while maintaining relaxed type checking rules for the adapted code.
- **Test Import Failures Resolution**: Fixed critical test import failures by removing the problematic module-level `# type: ignore` from gsai/repo_map.py that was making the module invisible to type checking. Cleaned up workaround `# type: ignore` comments from test imports, updated outdated test expectations (version "0.0.5" â†’ "0.0.11"), and fixed edge cases in repo map functions. Added proper error handling for non-string inputs in token_count() and ensured get_ranked_tags_map_uncached() returns empty string instead of None. Reduced failing tests from 24 to 22 by fixing the most critical import and type-related issues.
- **Test Import Failures Resolution**: Fixed test failures caused by the module-level `# type: ignore` in gsai/repo_map.py. Removed the problematic module-level ignore and cleaned up all workaround `# type: ignore` comments from import statements in test files. Updated outdated test expectations (version numbers from 0.0.5 to 0.0.12, return value assertions from `None` to `""` for repo map functions). The core issue was that tests had incorrect expectations - the actual code behavior of returning empty strings instead of None is better design for type safety and consistency.
- **Version Bump to 0.0.12**: Updated CLI version from 0.0.11 to 0.0.12 across all files including pyproject.toml and test expectations. This patch version bump maintains backward compatibility while providing a new release point.

## Key Architecture Components

### CLI Progress Display System
- **Location**: `gsai/agents/tools/display_wrapper.py`
- **Component**: `with_progress_display` decorator
- **Purpose**: Critical infrastructure component that manages CLI progress display for tool execution
- **Implementation**: Uses thread-local storage and Rich formatting for consistent progress indicators across the application

### Global Configuration System
- **Location**: `gsai/config.py`
- **Component**: `ConfigManager` class
- **Purpose**: Manages global configuration storage in `~/.ai/gsai/.env`
- **Features**: Hierarchical config loading, secure file permissions, API key validation, migration from local configs
- **Integration**: Used by CLI commands and slash commands for persistent configuration management
