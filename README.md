## Installation

### One-Click Installer (Recommended)

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
# Clone and run installer
git clone <repository-url>
cd gitstart-cli
./install.sh
```

**Windows:**
```bat
REM Clone and run installer
git clone <repository-url>
cd gitstart-cli
install.bat
```

**Or use the quick installer:**
```bash
# One-liner installer (Linux/macOS)
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-repo/gitstart-cli/master/quick-install.sh | bash
```

The installer will:
- ‚úÖ Check all prerequisites (Python 3.12+, uv)
- ‚úÖ Install missing dependencies automatically
- ‚úÖ Configure API keys securely
- ‚úÖ Install the CLI globally
- ‚úÖ Test the installation

### Manual Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12+
- Git (for repository operations)
- OpenAI API key and/or Anthropic API key

### Install with uv (Manual)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd gitstart-cli

# Install with uv
uv sync

# Install the CLI globally
uv tool install .
```

### Install with pip

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd gitstart-cli

# Install dependencies
pip install -e .
```

## Getting Started

### 1. Initial Setup

After installation, gsai uses a global configuration system that stores your settings in `~/.ai/gsai/.env`. This means you only need to configure your API keys once, and they'll work across all your projects.

```bash
# Configure your API keys and preferences
gsai configure
```

This interactive setup will guide you through:
- **API Keys**: Set up OpenAI and/or Anthropic API keys (at least one required)
- **Approval Mode**: Choose your security preference (see below)
- **Web Search**: Enable/disable web search capabilities
- **Model Preferences**: Select which AI models to use

### 2. Understanding Approval Modes

Choose the approval mode that fits your workflow:

- **`suggest`** (Recommended for beginners): Read-only mode that shows you what changes would be made and asks for approval
- **`auto-edit`**: Automatically edits files but asks permission before running commands
- **`full-auto`**: Makes changes and runs commands without approval (use with caution)

You can change this anytime with `gsai configure` or using slash commands during chat.

### 3. Start Your First Coding Session

Navigate to your project directory and start a chat session:

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd /path/to/your/project

# Start gsai in the current directory
gsai chat

# Or specify a different directory
gsai chat --directory /path/to/another/project
```

### 4. In-Session Commands

Once in a chat session, you have access to powerful slash commands:

```
/help              # Show all available slash commands
/config or /status # Check your current configuration
/set-api-key       # Update API keys without leaving the session
/migrate-config    # Migrate local .env to global configuration
```

### 5. Your First AI Interactions

Here are some great ways to get started:

**Explore your codebase:**
```
üí¨ You: What does this project do? Can you give me an overview of the codebase structure?

ü§ñ AI: I'll analyze your project structure and give you a comprehensive overview...
```

**Get help with specific code:**
```
üí¨ You: I have a function in src/utils.py that's running slowly. Can you help optimize it?

ü§ñ AI: I'll examine the function in src/utils.py and suggest optimizations...
```

**Implement new features:**
```
üí¨ You: I need to add user authentication to my Flask app. Can you help me implement it?

ü§ñ AI: I'll help you implement user authentication. Let me first understand your current Flask setup...
```

**Debug issues:**
```
üí¨ You: I'm getting a "TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable" error. Can you help me find and fix it?

ü§ñ AI: I'll help you debug this TypeError. Let me search for potential causes in your code...
```

### 6. Check Your Setup

Verify everything is working correctly:

```bash
# Check your configuration and API key status
gsai status

# View version information
gsai version
```

### 7. Pro Tips for New Users

- **Start with `suggest` mode**: This lets you see what gsai would do before it makes changes
- **Use specific requests**: Instead of "fix my code," try "optimize the database query in models.py"
- **Leverage codebase exploration**: Ask gsai to explain unfamiliar code before making changes
- **Take advantage of git integration**: gsai can create meaningful commit messages for your changes

## Commands

```

## Architecture

### Agent System
- **Master Agent**: Orchestrates task delegation and provides unified interface
- **Specialized Agents**: Handle specific domains (coding, Q&A, git, planning)
- **Tool Integration**: Comprehensive set of development tools

```bash
# Type checking
uv run mypy .

# Linting and formatting
uv run ruff format

# Run tests
uv run pytest
```

These commands should be run in sequence after any code modifications to maintain code quality and consistency.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No API keys configured"**
- Run `gsai configure` to set up your API keys
- Ensure at least one of OPENAI_API_KEY or ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is set

**"Operation denied: Path outside working directory"**
- The CLI restricts operations to the working directory for security
- Use `--directory` to specify the correct working directory

**"Parser not available for language"**
- Some advanced features require tree-sitter language parsers
- Most common languages are supported out of the box

### Getting Help

- Use `gsai --help` for command information
- Check `gsai status` for configuration issues
- Review logs for detailed error information
