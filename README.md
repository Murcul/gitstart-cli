## ‚ö° Quick Start

### 1. Install and Configure

```bash
# Download and install (Linux/macOS)
curl -L -o gsai https://github.com/your-org/gitstart-cli/releases/latest/download/gsai-$(uname -s | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')-x86_64
chmod +x gsai && sudo mv gsai /usr/local/bin/

# Configure API keys
gsai configure
```

### 2. Start Coding with AI

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd your-project

# Start AI coding session
gsai chat
```

**That's it!** You're now ready to code with AI assistance.

### 3. Try These Commands

```bash
You: What does this project do? Give me an overview.
You: Add error handling to the login function in auth.py
You: Create a Python function to validate email addresses
You: Review my recent changes and suggest improvements
```

## üìã Initial Setup Details

After installation, gsai uses a global configuration system that stores your settings in `~/.ai/gsai/.env`. This means you only need to configure your API keys once, and they'll work across all your projects.

```bash
# Configure your API keys and preferences
gsai configure
```

This interactive setup will guide you through:
- **API Keys**: Set up OpenAI and/or Anthropic API keys (at least one required)
- **Approval Mode**: Choose your security preference (see below)
- **Web Search**: Enable/disable web search capabilities
- **Model Preferences**: Select which AI models to use

### 2. Understanding Approval Modes

Choose the approval mode that fits your workflow:

- **`suggest`** (Recommended for beginners): Read-only mode that shows you what changes would be made and asks for approval
- **`auto-edit`**: Automatically edits files but asks permission before running commands
- **`full-auto`**: Makes changes and runs commands without approval (use with caution)

You can change this anytime with `gsai configure` or using slash commands during chat.

### 3. Start Your First Coding Session

Navigate to your project directory and start a chat session:

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd /path/to/your/project

# Start gsai in the current directory
gsai chat

# Or specify a different directory
gsai chat --directory /path/to/another/project
```

### 4. In-Session Commands

Once in a chat session, you have access to powerful slash commands:

```
/help              # Show all available slash commands
/config or /status # Check your current configuration
/set-api-key       # Update API keys without leaving the session
/migrate-config    # Migrate local .env to global configuration
```

### 5. Your First AI Interactions

Here are some great ways to get started:

**Explore your codebase:**
```
üí¨ You: What does this project do? Can you give me an overview of the codebase structure?

ü§ñ AI: I'll analyze your project structure and give you a comprehensive overview...
```

**Get help with specific code:**
```
üí¨ You: I have a function in src/utils.py that's running slowly. Can you help optimize it?

ü§ñ AI: I'll examine the function in src/utils.py and suggest optimizations...
```

**Implement new features:**
```
üí¨ You: I need to add user authentication to my Flask app. Can you help me implement it?

ü§ñ AI: I'll help you implement user authentication. Let me first understand your current Flask setup...
```

**Debug issues:**
```
üí¨ You: I'm getting a "TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable" error. Can you help me find and fix it?

ü§ñ AI: I'll help you debug this TypeError. Let me search for potential causes in your code...
```

### 6. Check Your Setup

Verify everything is working correctly:

```bash
# Check your configuration and API key status
gsai status

# View version information
gsai version
```

### 7. Pro Tips for New Users

- **Start with `suggest` mode**: This lets you see what gsai would do before it makes changes
- **Use specific requests**: Instead of "fix my code," try "optimize the database query in models.py"
- **Leverage codebase exploration**: Ask gsai to explain unfamiliar code before making changes
- **Take advantage of git integration**: gsai can create meaningful commit messages for your changes

## Commands

### `gsai chat`
Start an interactive AI coding session
- `--directory, -d`: Specify working directory (defaults to current)

ü§ñ AI: I'll help you plan the implementation of user roles and permissions. Let me break this down into steps...
```

## Architecture

### Agent System
- **Master Agent**: Orchestrates task delegation and provides unified interface
- **Specialized Agents**: Handle specific domains (coding, Q&A, git, planning)
- **Tool Integration**: Comprehensive set of development tools

### Security Model
- **Path Validation**: All operations validated against working directory
- **Approval Workflows**: User confirmation for sensitive operations
- **Usage Tracking**: Monitor token and request consumption

### Tool Ecosystem
- **File Operations**: Read, write, move, and modify files safely
- **Code Analysis**: Search, parse, and understand code structure
- **Development Tools**: Linting, git operations, and project navigation

```bash
# Type checking
uv run mypy .

# Linting and formatting
uv run ruff format

# Run tests
uv run pytest
```

These commands should be run in sequence after any code modifications to maintain code quality and consistency.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No API keys configured"**
- Run `gsai configure` to set up your API keys
- Ensure at least one of OPENAI_API_KEY or ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is set

**"Operation denied: Path outside working directory"**
- The CLI restricts operations to the working directory for security
- Use `--directory` to specify the correct working directory

**"Parser not available for language"**
- Some advanced features require tree-sitter language parsers
- Most common languages are supported out of the box

### Getting Help

- Use `gsai --help` for command information
- Check `gsai status` for configuration issues
- Review logs for detailed error information
